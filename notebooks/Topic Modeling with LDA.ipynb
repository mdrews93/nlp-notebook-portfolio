This happened once to me last week on this VM and I was able to isolate and reboot the host that was holding the lock, but this time the owner UUID is displaying all zeroes instead of a meaningful UUID containing the MAC address of the host (as\\ndocumented in the links below).\\n\\nhttps://vbrownbag.com/2015/12/the-infamous-disklock-error/\\n\\nhttps://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2107795\\n\\nhttps://kb.vmware.com/s/article/10051\\n\\nI have not yet removed the VM from inventory and added it back.   \n",
       "42  How to reclaim space on RDM disk mapped to VM guest? The disk is fully provisioned. We are using:\\n- VSphere ESXi 6.0\\n- Dell Equallogic PS 6100 E\\n\\nHere are the issues:\\n- Disk size shows 1.33 TB free space inside VM Guest (Windows Server 2012). Whereas on Dell Equallogic it shows only 90 GB Free.\\n- Disk is mapped as RDM disk. Directly attached to the VM guest. So the unmap command to free space is not working.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
