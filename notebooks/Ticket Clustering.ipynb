    "The model will analyze the information provided by the ticket and the user interactions with the ticket to illuminate ticket similarities within a specific repository or project that could give further insight on the code associated. We're trying to discover if similarities between ticket, specifically negative, can give further insight into the code and better help the user understand their code base. "

    "To fully know the impact of the type of similarities discovered from the tickets, examination of the code will be conducted. But in a general sense, grouping and visualizing the way all tickets are interacting within the repository or codebase can provide important information to the user. The groupings can be further specified to the individual user and show how those interact with other tickets. This information can lead the user to dig deeper into effects or problems occuring from a certain cluster of tickets. "

The most important is that it is not a good idea to modify the global `Date` constructor.

Instead, it is better to define a local `CronDate` constructor and to stick to it internally, making sure that all dates are converted to it..

The issue is that we are calling prototype functions inside the constructor for CronJob.  There are two functions called: addCallback and start but from what I saw they were not yet considered defined because the prototype assignment came later.  The first approach I took is not what fixed it but it may have effected the end format of my fix.  The first thing was to assign each function as a member of the original prototype instead of reassignment.  That of course is just style but it might be the right stile for the fix in the end.  The next step, and successful step was to change it to the form CronJob.prototype.addCallback = addCallback function addCallback(callback) { ... } Then the call in the constructor was addCallback.call(this);  The next function, start, was a bit more tricky because start is a variable inside the constructor.  So it's named function form was startFunc. The the client for it in the constructor was: if(start) startFunc.call(this);  My version is v0.10.26. \",\n",

I'm trying to prevent these jobs from overlapping and the method is not the most elegant.  Right now I'm setting an active parameter to the `this` object and have an condition to catch if the job is currently executing.  Would it be possible to make something like this built in and is there better way to do it?  Thanks!  ``` var job = new CronJob({     cronTime: '* * * * * *',     onTick: () => {          if (typeof this.isCurrentlyExecuting === 'undefined') {              this.isCurrentlyExecuting = false;          }          if (this.isCurrentlyExecuting) {              console.log(moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.SS - ') + 'Job already running.

I\\'m maintaining a \"[temporal frequency library](https://github.com/smhg/date-frequency-js)\" which allows you to retrieve the next occurrence of a frequency specification (which the cron format also is). It offers more (theoretically all?) frequency specifications than cron\\'s format and is strongly inspired by the [ISO 8601 duration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals) notation.  Although it also has an API to specify frequencies, its string format is the simplest way to specify a frequency:  ``` javascript var frequency = new Frequency(\\'F1DT0H0M0S\\'); // every first day of the month at midnight console.log(frequency.next(new Date())); // get the next occurence ```  Some more possible specs: - `F3D/WT0M0S`: every hour of every 3rd day of the week (Wednesday, as in ISO 8601) - `F30M0S`: every 30 minutes past the hour  And specs with filters: - `F(leap)Y1M1DT0H0M0S`: every January 1st at midnight of leap years - `F(odd)W/ET10H0M0S`: every day at 10:00:00 of odd weeks  > _Small note on the above: the week of E - epoch (year 0) - scope is necessary to have a consistent week number (as week of year would sometimes result in week 53 preceding week 1)_  Every filter needs to be made available in the `Frequency.fn` object before use like so:  ``` javascript Frequency.fn.odd = require(\\'number-kind\\').odd; Frequency.fn.leap = require(\\'leap-year\\'); ```  Some notes: - The original motivation was the lack of flexibility in cron\\'s format and the lack of any other string notation in general. - It supports [moment](http://www.momentjs.com/) or any object with a `toDate` method. - It is used in production, but not feature complete. Any contributions are highly appreciated.  Could it be of any use for **node-cron**? ',\n",

Wouldn\\'t it be reasonable to add an option (at least one) for users to backup those jobs somehow or should that rather be handled on per user basis?  [related example](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5636298/390493)  API might look like that:  ``` javascript var cronJob = require(\\'cron\\').CronJob; cronJob.backup(true, \\'jobs\\'); // (Boolean enable [, String collection] ) - for all newly created jobs var job = new cronJob({   cronTime: \\'00 30 11 * * 1-5\\',   onTick: function() {     // Runs every weekday (Monday through Friday)     // at 11:30:00 AM.

       "              \"I'm using node-cron with CoffeeScript and I have difficult using it.  This is the code how I create new CronJob  ``` coffeescript daily = new CronJob   cromTime: '00 00 00 * * *'   onTick: ->     cronTask('daily')   start: false ```  I follow the sample code in the README.md. https://github.com/ncb000gt/node-cron#for-good-measure ,And I think my code should be fine, but it's not actually working. It will pops up error like this:  ```     source = this.source.replace(/[a-z]{1,3}/ig, function(alias){                          ^ TypeError: Cannot call method 'replace' of undefined     at Object.CronTime._parse (/.../node_modules/cron/lib/cron.js:173:26) ```  I have no idea what happen, so I look into the code of node-cron. It's seems I cannot pass a JSON object for creating new CronJob Object. I'm not sure if this was the problem, But It should need to change. This is the code from connect-redis which I think is a better way to create new object:  ``` javascript  function RedisStore(options) {     ...     options = options || {};     Store.call(this, options);     this.prefix = null == options.prefix       ? 'sess:'       : options.prefix;      this.client = options.client || new redis.createClient(options.port || options.socket, options.host, options);     if (options.pass) {       ...        }      this.ttl =  options.ttl;     ...   }; ```  There are many options to create a CronJob while only two attributes is required. And the current way to create a CronJob will make the code written in CofeeScript become really messy.  I hope you can consider changing it. Thank you.  \",\n",
       "              'Actually this is not a question I think but more a remark. I was curious what kind of behavior to except when I drown node-cron in to much work. I created a job with an interval of 1 second and in the job I incremented an int via redis (loop with 100k increments).   I measured that on my computer every three seconds the cron job actually starts (and finishes). So I think (this is a question ;-) ) node-cron drops job requests when it is to busy (which is off-course fine and totally OK).   Am I right? ',\n",

After a day o so I get the following error on the Heroku logs:  ``` Error R14 (Memory quota exceeded) Process running mem=520M(101.7%) ```  Until it finally crashes.  My app has 3 crons. 1 runs once a month, 1 once a day and another that runs every 30 seconds. I'm guessing the problem should be on the last one, my code for said cronjob looks a little like:  ``` var y = null; new cronJob('*/30 * * * * *', function (){     request.get(url, function(err, response, body) {             var x = JSON.parse(response).data;             if(x.length > 0){                 if(!y) y = new Date(x[0].createdAt)                 else{                     var z = null;                     for(var i=0; i < x.length; i++){                         var p = new Date(x[i].createdAt);                         if(p > y){                              //it never passed here when the leak happened                             ...                         }else  break;                     }                 }             }         }     });  }, null, true, null); ```  I've started using Nodetime to determine where's the leak but I honestly don't understand the memory profiler output, here it's part of it in case it helps:  ``` Retainers     87% - Other         Size (KB): 28856.977         Size (%): 87         Count: 30601         Count (%): 43         Largest instances             native object: Buffer             native object: Buffer             native object: Buffer             array: (object properties)             array: (object properties)             array             string: (function (exports, requi...             string: (function (exports, requi...             array: (object properties)             array: (object properties)         Random instances             ...     8% - Hidden links         Size (KB): 2746.141         Size (%): 8         Count: 24476         Count (%): 34         Largest instances             array             compiled code             compiled code             compiled code             compiled code             compiled code             compiled code             compiled code             array             compiled code         Random instances             ...     2% - Array elements         Size (KB): 780.516         Size (%): 2         Count: 3660         Count (%): 5         Largest instances             array             compiled code             compiled code             compiled code             compiled code             compiled code: (code)             compiled code: (code)             compiled code             compiled code             compiled code: (code)         Random instances             ...     0% - Property: body     0% - Property: _label     0% - Property: Size (KB)     0% - Weak references     0% - Property: prototype     0% - Property: readme     0% - Property: _readableState     0% - Property: children     0% - Property: paths     0% - Property: exports     0% - Variable: orig     0% - Property: Name     0% - Property: _writableState     0% - Variable: func     0% - Property: source     0% - Variable: hook     0% - Property: constructor     0% - Property: id     0% - Variable: hookBefore     0% - Property: write     0% - Variable: fn     0% - Property: buffer Objects     65% - Buffer         Size (KB): 21536.867         Size (%): 65         Count: 27         Count (%): 0         Largest instances             native object: Buffer             native object: Buffer             native object: Buffer             native object: Buffer             native object: Buffer             native object: Buffer             native object: Buffer             object: Buffer             object: Buffer             object: Buffer         Random instances             ...     15% - Array         Size (KB): 4800.617         Size (%): 15         Count: 16693         Count (%): 23         Largest instances             array             array: (object properties)             array: (object properties)             array             array: (object properties)             array: (object properties)             array: (object properties)             array: (object properties)             array: (object properties)             array: (object properties)         Random instances             ...     9% - String         Size (KB): 2969.656         Size (%): 9         Count: 26665         Count (%): 38         Largest instances             string: (function (exports, requi...             string: (function (exports, requi...             string: (function (exports, requi...             string: (function (exports, requi...             string: (function (exports, requi...             string: (function (exports, requi...             string: (function (exports, requi...             string: (function (exports, requi...             string: (function (exports, requi...             string: (function (exports, requi...

By looking at the code, I see that each task has a 1000-millisecond interval callback all the times, and at each call, if the current time matches, the job runs. Sometimes, when multiple jobs are called at the same second, and plus slow CPU or heavy task or slow nodejs or the callback happens to be at the very end of that second, some of them might skipped the second 0 (if the second is not set, it will default to 0) and they will not run. In other words, this mechanism is very unreliable.  I don't see any quick fix for this. I think the best way is the node-scheduler way, which calculate the next running time for each task and set only one callback (instead of call every second which consumes CPU).  If you are using this for serious jobs like the cron replacement in a server, I highly recommend you to switch another lib.
